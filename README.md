# MAD - Level 4: Task 1

This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development at HvA.
The application is used as an introduction to using local storage to make the data persisted.

This application is used as a shopping list where users can add `x` amount of products to the list.
Those items can then later removed per product type or all products at once.
